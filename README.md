# mother_care

As a loving father of a five-month-old son, I felt a strong urge to use my skills and knowledge to support my family. That's why I created this Progressive Web Application (PWA) for my wife, to assist her in managing the breastfeeding process. It's a straightforward, serverless solution that keeps all data securely stored in the local storage of the device. Although it's currently a minimal, stable version, I am committed to adding new features as needed in the future to make it even more useful for my wife and others.
